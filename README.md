# Template
Based on the EDGI Repo Guidelines at https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/main/repo_guidelines.md

This repo contains code and data inputs/outputs related to the Climate Data Project by EDGI.

# How to start contributing to this repo
* When using SOE_GHG_2.ipynb, the primary notebook where analysis is done, please CLEAR THE OUTPUT of the cells that produce maps before committing code to this repo. The outputted maps can make the file size massive.
* It is recommended to install VSCode and search for Notebook/Python installation through the VSCode store.

**Suggestions for additional components of Readmes:**
* A "How to use" section if the repo's project is a tool or website
* A link to the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+user%3Aedgi-govdata-archiving) label (this link across EDGI, or a specific link for the repo)
* Highlight "ready" label on issues to mean "this is an issue that is ready to work on and needs an owner"
* Additional badges at the top, such as code quality indicators
* "[All contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key)" listing, following these additional guidelines (example: [web-monitoring-db contributors list](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db#contributors)):
  - Compact representation without avatars (less visual noise; easier to focus on contributions)
  - Icons are links with title attributes (accessibility)
  - Alphabetical order by surname/name/username (to eliminate implied ranking)
  - Presence in the list (and the name used) is optional and up to the contributor (not everyone wants to be listed — we offer, but do not add unless someone explicitly says yes)

**When using this template, please look through all of the files to ensure they apply to the new repo.**
